## Motivation
I learnt multi label cassification through fatai lectures 'Practical Deep Learning for Coders' by Jeremy Howard.
In the class, Jeremy shows how to apply mutilabel classification to satellite images. I wanted to practice what he taught. But as in the machine learning industry they say, "Never test your model on your training set", rather than reworking the same project I applied my knowledge to a different dataset. This technique was amazing and I learnt a lot more than I would have learnt by just making the same project.

The biggest thing I learned was the ability to read Fastai source code and identify bugs in it. I even wrote my own code to get better results.

## Getting Started
Just download the Clothing_Classifier_with_fastai_2.ipynb notebook or click on open in colab.
In notebook settings choose GPU. The notebook is well-documented, so just follow the instructions and you will be fine.

### Pre-requisites
Python 3
Fastai
Jupyter Notebook

### Installing

If you are running on Google Colaboratory, you will be fine with python 3. But, you still might have to install Fastai
Here is the link to official fastai setup instructions for colab https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html
